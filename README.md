# Urban Dictionary Search

Simple Google Chrome extension that grabs definitions from [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/). 

Since Urban Dictionary (currently) doesn't have an official API, the definitions are web scraped. For that reason the extension might break at any time (I doubt it will be anytime soon, though, since UD seems to be rarely updated). I probably won't update this extension anymore so if it breaks feel free to fork away and fix it.

 ~~It is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfjijibnpohkjdmbahejpeoilmgjahei)~~. It was once in the Chrome Web Store but I've since transferred ownership to another person.

# Installation

Download the [APP CRX](https://github.com/ltmatos/urbandictionary-search/blob/master/urbandictionary-search.crx?raw=true).
